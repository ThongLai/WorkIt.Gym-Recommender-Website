Welcome to the WorkIt AI Exercise Recommender Website, a web-based application designed to assist users in finding the perfect gym exercises tailored to their needs.

## Project Overview

WorkIt is an innovative web application that leverages artificial intelligence to recommend exercises based on user input. The application is currently built using a combination of front-end and back-end static web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. (*Note: This is just a quick demo work, the project will be migrated to dynamic web technologies soon!).

## Tech Stack

* **Front-end:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Back-end:** Python, Flask
* **Database:** MySQL RDS
* **AI Model:** TensorFlow, scikit-learn
* **Deployment:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) including `EC2`, `S3`, `Aurora and RDS`
* **Package Manager:** Poetry
* **Operating System:** Windows, Linux

These technologies work together to provide a scalable, secure, and reliable platform for the WorkIt AI Exercise Recommender Website.

## File Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

* `AI/`: Contains the artificial intelligence component of the project, including dataset files, trained model files, and notebooks for training and prediction.
* `css/`: Contains the main stylesheet for the website.
* `images/`: Contains images used on the website.
* `js/`: Contains JavaScript files used on the website.
* `sign_up/`: Contains the sign-up page for the website.
* `root/`: Contains the main homepage, recommendation page, and video display page.

## AI Component

The AI component of the project is built using Python and utilizes the following files:

* `data/megaGymDataset_original.csv`: The original dataset used for training the model.
* `data/megaGymDataset.csv`: The processed dataset used for training the model.
* `model/`: Contains trained model files.
* `notebook/`: Contains notebooks for training and prediction, including `Train.ipynb`, `Predict.ipynb`, and `Ratings Assignments.ipynb`.
* `script/Predict.py`: Contains the prediction implementation using Flask.

## Website

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the following files:

* `index.php`: The main homepage of the website.
* `recommender.php`: The recommendation page of the website.
* `video.php`: The video display page of the website.
* `css/style.css`: The main stylesheet for the website.
* `js/`: Contains JavaScript files used on the website.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/WorkIt-Gym-Recommender-Website.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd WorkIt-Gym-Recommender-Website`
3. Install dependencies: `poetry install`
4. Run the Flask server: `python script/Predict.py`
5. Open the website in your web browser: `http://localhost:5000`

## Deployment

The WorkIt AI Exercise Recommender Website is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing a combination of services to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance. The project is deployed using the following AWS services:

* **EC2**: Provides a scalable and secure environment for the Flask server, allowing for easy management and monitoring of the application.
* **RDS**: Offers a managed relational database service, enabling the storage and management of user data, exercise recommendations, and other relevant information.
* **S3**: Provides a durable and highly available object store, used for storing and serving static assets, such as images, and CSS files.
